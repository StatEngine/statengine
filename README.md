## Stat Engine
Accelerating wide-scale public safety adoption of data analytics by simplifying the installation, integration, and exploitation of powerful open source analysis tools.

### The Problem
Public Safety Organizations (PSO) are finding it increasingly difficult to balance limited resources while
simultaneously justifying current operations and adapting to changing service expectations. By
effectively analyzing and visualizing data, PSOs can proactively monitor changing response
landscapes and make data driven decisions while objectively monitoring the outcome. This can
impact all aspects of a PSO, including staffing levels, development of standard operating
procedures and internal policies, training efforts, and resource deployments. Although it is hard
to deny the impact of data analytics in the public sector, analyzing and visualizing data is not an
easy feat.

Today, effective data exploitation requires proprietary software licenses, specialized
knowledge of tools, and in-house technical expertise that public safety organizations often lack.  StatEngine is being developed as a set of open tools that can be leveraged by the public safety community to reduce the barrier of entry to  data analytics.

### Our Approach
StatEngine stands on the shoulders of giants to provide best-of-breed open source solutions to the public safety community.  This allows us to focus on reducing implementation complexity and tailoring the tools to needs of PSOs instead of reinventing the wheel.

### About the Project
Funding for StatEngine has been awarded to [Prominent Edge](http://prominentedge.com) by the [Public Safety Innovation Accelerator Program](https://www.nist.gov/ctl/pscr/funding-partnerships/grants/psiap-fy2017).  The period of performance for the project is from May 2017 through May 2019.

### Principal Investigator
The Principal Investigator for StatEngine is [Tyler Garner](https://github.com/garnertb).  Tyler is the co-founder of Prominent Edge and has over 10 years of operational and administrative experience in the fire service.  He is a member of NFPA Technical Committees 950 and 951.

### Public Safety Partners
* [Hanover Fire & EMS](https://www.hanovercounty.gov/297/Fire-EMS)

### Outputs
New libraries will be added throughout the life of the project.  (Names subject to change).

* **Data Watcher**: Abstracts common complexities involved in retrieving data from public safety data sources.

* **Schema Library**: A set of re-usable and extensible JSON schemas that model public safety operations.
